## Preparing to run the pipeline (20 minutes)

### Installing the dependencies

Make sure all requirements are satisfied in the "Installation" and "Dependencies" sections of [README.md](README.md). A c-shell environment (csh/tcsh) must be activated when installing NMRPipe and working with `process.py`: 
1. Install [NMRPipe](https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/install.html). On a Mac, the installation process should look something like this:
    ```
    csh
    cd
    mkdir nmr
    cd nmr

    curl -O https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/install.com
    curl -O https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/binval.com
    curl -O https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/NMRPipeX.tZ
    curl -O https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/s.tZ
    curl -O https://www.ibbr.umd.edu/nmrpipe/dyn.tZ

    chmod a+r  *.tZ *.Z *.tar
    chmod a+rx *.com

    ./install.com
    ```
    Check your `.cshrc` file for the initialize commands.
    ```
    cd
    cat .cshrc
    ```
      The file should contain the following lines:
    ```
    if (-e /path/to/nmr/com/nmrInit.mac11_64.com) then
       source /path/to/nmr/com/nmrInit.mac11_64.com
    endif
    ```
    If the lines are missing or the .cshrc file does not exist, open the file `README_NMRPIPE_USERS` in the `nmr` folder you just created and find the lines that match the ones above. Copy them into .cshrc file. Then log out and log back in again.  

2. Download the repository with `git clone https://github.com/Massachusetts-Host-Microbiome-Center/nmr-cdiff.git` or using the GitHub Desktop app.  
3. Set up the virtual environment. From the `nmr-cdiff` base directory:
    ```
    cd etc
    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate.csh
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Now, you have all the dependencies for this repository installed in the virtual environment `env`. Now that the environment is set up, you do not need to run the above code again. However, when you start a session, you must activate the virtual environment as follows:
    ```
    csh
    source nmr-cdiff/etc/env/bin/activate.csh 
    ```       

### Test data

One short unprocessed NMR run and two processed runs are included in the [test data](data/test) folder:
 - [20210519_13CGlc](data/test/20210519_13CGlc) : a short unprocessed glucose run  
 - [20210322_13CLeu](data/test/20210322_13CLeu) : a short processed leucine run  
 - [20220421_13CGlc_standards](data/test/20220421_13CGlc_standards) : a processed dataset of standard solutions supporting the dFBA analyses

We will process the glucose run and simulate dFBA. For convenience, we have included `cfg_13C.txt` and `cfg_1H.txt` in the run directory, which contain reference chemical shifts for the substrate and expected products. For each substrate, these files must be prepared before processing is run.

## Processing the NMR runs (15 minutes per run)
### The Stack object
We will begin by processing the NMR datasets using the [process.py](scripts/process/process.py) script. Navigate to the directory containing the python scripts, and start an interactive python session.  
```
cd nmr-cdiff/scripts/process
python3
```
Now, we will import the Stack class from process.py and create a Stack object for our NMR run. This will serve as the basis for our processing functions. When we create the Stack object, we will need to specify the filepath of the run, as well as the isotope and the spectrum FID to use as the timestamp anchor.
```
from process import Stack
s = Stack("nmr-cdiff/data/test/20210519_13CGlc", "13C", "52")
```
This will create a stack object for our test glucose run, and specify that we want to process the 13C spectra with FID number 52 as our anchor.  

Our `Stack` object `s` has several useful attributes and methods that we will use:  
Attributes:  
* `s.refpeaks` : a pandas dataframe that stores the reference peaks from `cfg_13C.txt`. You can manually load a new config with the line `s.refpeaks = s.load_cfg()`.  
* `s.ordered_fids` : a list of strings, representing the names of the FIDs to be included in the Stack. Set this manually if automatic FID detection fails.  
* `s.spectra` : a dictionary mapping the FIDs' string labels to Spectrum objects. For example, to access FID \#23, use `spec = s.spectra["23"]`. This dictionary is populated by `s.process_fids()`.  

Methods:  
* `s.calibrate()` : a method that finds calibration parameters for processing. This method must be run before `process_fids()`.  
* `s.process_fids()` : this function process all FIDs in a Stack. The processing function `process_fids` has several keyword arguments that affect the function's behavior:  
    * `man_ps` : whether to perform manual phase correction for each spectrum (default: `False`).  
    * `auto_bl` : whether to use NMRPipe's automatic baseline correction (default: `True`, recommended for 13C spectra).  
    * `man_bl` : whether to use the in-house manual baseline correction with draggable nodes and spline fit (default: `False`, recommended for 1H\[13Ced\] spectra).  
    * `overwrite` : whether to force overwrite of existing processed spectra (default: `False`).  
* `s.peakfit_fids()` : a method to perform peak-picking and curve fitting on all spectra in the Stack. In addition to the following keyword arguments, this function can pass any additioal keyword arguments to `spec.peak_fit()`.
    * `overwrite` : whether to force overwrite of existing fit peaks (default: `False`).
    * `method` : the method to use for finding peaks. Supported: `"ng_pick"` (default): use nmrglue's peak-picking algorithm, recommended for 13C; `"sg_pick"`: use in-house Savitsky-Golay filtering algorithm, recommended for 1H\[13Ced\].  
* `s.ridgetrace_fids()` : an alternative to `peakfit_fids`, this method tracks amplitude rather than peak area for all peaks specified in `refpeaks`. 
* `s.write_stack()` : write the processed spectra, reference peaks, and/or compound-designated peak areas to an Excel spreadsheet. This can be thought of as "exporting" the processed Stack.
    * `suffix` : a suffix to add to the end of the filename, which is helpful if different versions are desired.
    * `from_ridges` : whether to populate the "areas" tab with the `ridgetrace_fids` output instead of the `peakfit_fids` output (default: `False`).

### Find the calibration parameters
Let's first find some calibration parameters to make processing go faster. We will need to run our Stack's `calibrate` method.
```
s.calibrate()
```
1. You will first be prompted for phase correction.  
    1. First, find the ppm shift of the **right-most** peak using the cursor on the plot. Next, slide the **pivot** slider to match this value.  
    2. Adjust the **p0** slider until the **right-most** peak is well-phased.  
    3. Adjust the **p1** slider until the **left-most** peak is well-phased.  
    4. Adjust **p0** and **p1** slightly until all peaks are well-phased.  

    Press the "Set Phases" button, and close the window. For this spectrum, **p0=70.3** and **p1=99.9** were appropriate values.  

1. Next, you will be prompted to calibrate the reference shift.
    1. Find a well-separated peak in the reference 13C spectrum of Glucose. The peak at **72.405 ppm** appears suitable in [this reference spectrum from HMDB](https://hmdb.ca/spectra/nmr_one_d/166522). Type this in the field for the reference peak.
    1. Next, find the corresponding peak in the spectrum, which may be slightly shifted from 72.405 ppm. Use the zoom tool to locate the peak and cursor to find the chemical shift at the center of the peak. Enter this experimental chemical shift and click Submit.  

These parameters will be stored to aid with processing each remaining spectrum in the run. Additionally, they will be saved so that if you exit the python session and create a new Stack for this run, the stored parameters will be loaded.

### Process the 13C spectra
Processing will now begin, and should be rather quick. Run `process_fids`:
```
s.process_fids()
```
Unless you have set `man_ps=True` or `man_bl=True`, this should be entirely automated, and will likely take less than a minute. Use `man_ps=True` to adjust the phase correction of each spectrum individually as described above, recommended if the phase deviates throughout the course of the run. Use `man_bl=True` for spectra where the NMRPipe baseline correction fails, especially for 1H\[13Ced\] spectra. For `man_bl=True`, adjust the nodes for the spline fit by removing or dragging nodes not on the baseline. Note: ensure that the order of the nodes is maintained as you drag them. Also, adding new nodes may cause unexpected behavior as this function has not been thoroughly tested.

### Peak-fit the 13C spectra
Now, we will fit curves to the NMR peaks:
```
s.peakfit_fids()
```

1. The peak-picking algorithm will automatically find peaks in the spectrum. At times, manual peak assignment may be required if peaks are close to each other. If this is the case, a pop-up window will show where each peak is labeled by a numbered index. In the right panel, the conflicting reference shifts will be listed. Make note of which peaks belong to which compounds. In the right panel, list the indices belonging to each compound, separated by spaces. Click Submit.  
1. The program will next perform curve-fitting on the found peaks. If this is taking too long, it may be beneficial to interrupt the processing and try this spectrum again with different values of `r` or `sep` passed to `peakfit_fids`.  
1. After automatic peak picking and fitting is completed for each spectrum, the spectrum will be plotted with the curve-fit and peak assignments overlaid. Advanced users may wish to inspect this spectrum for proper curve-fitting and add, remove, or adjust curves as needed. Use the "Edit Peak" tab to select and modify the parameters of existing peaks, the "Add Peak" tab to add a new peak, and the "Remove Peak" tab to remove the active peak.  

    In the plot window, the real spectrum is drawn in black, the simulated spectrum in blue, and the residuals in gray. The active peak is highlighted in red. The contributions of individual compounds are also plotted in different colors.  

    When selecting peaks or performing actions, it may take a few seconds for the active peak to update in the plot. Please be patient; if it's taking too long, try selecting different peaks in the dropdown to force an update.  

    If you have made modifications to the peaks, press the "Curve Fit" button before closing out to ensure that the curves form an optimal solution set.

### Process the 1H spectra
Now, run the processing script for the 1H spectra.
```
python ../../../scripts/process/process.py 1H 52
```
Follow the prompts as before. We used p0=155.8, p1=50.2, reference shift=1.9059, experimental shift=1.9046.

### Plotting the runs
A fully processed run can be plotted as a stack, as seen in Fig. 2a,c,e, using the MATLAB function [`plotStacks.m`](scripts/MATLAB/plotStack.m). This can be accomplished with relative ease using the script [`plot_stack.m`](scripts/MATLAB/call/plot_stack.m). Simply add a case for the run and set the variable `met`. You may also need to add a working filepath using the funciton `addpath`. The script is best run in batch mode from the command line:
```
matlab -nodisplay -nodesktop -batch "run('plot_stack.m');exit;"
```

### Additional processed runs
- The run [`20210322_13CLeu`](data/test/20210322_13CLeu) has already been processed for convenience.  
- The run [`20220421_13CGlc_standards`](data/test/20220421_13CGlc_standards) is a processed dataset of standard solutions supporting concentration estimates in the glucose run. The file `Concentrations.xlsx` in this directory contains the concentration of each compound in the processed spectra.

## Running the dFBA analyses (5 minutes)
### Overview of the script
Now that the runs are processed, we will simulate dFBA. The dFBA script will perform the following functions:  
1. Synchronize the NMR runs using the isocaproate trajectory from the 1H spectra.
2. Estimate concentration curves of the substrates and products using standard solutions.
    - The standards for glucose are included in the run `20220421_13CGlc_standards` and will be used to create standard curves that estimate relative NMR snesitivity of each compound with respect to glucose.
    - The expected ratios of isocaproate and isovalerate to leucine were estimated from gas chromatography experiments, and are included directly in  [`trajectories.py`](scripts/process/trajectories.py).
    - Plots of these curves as seen in Fig. 2b,d,f will be saved in each run folder.
3. Simulate dFBA using the estimated concentration curves as constraints for exchange fluxes.  

### Run the dFBA analyses
Run the dFBA script, [`dfba.py`](scripts/process/dfba.py):
```
cd ~/nmr-cdiff
python scripts/process/dfba.py fba data/test/20210519_13CGlc_13C data/test/20210322_13CLeu_13C
```
The first argument, `fba`, tells the script that we are computing a standard FBA solution at each time point. Next, we specify the directories containing the runs.

By default, we will only track a defined set of reactions and metabolites. These tracked elements can be modified by editing the `tracked_reactions` and `tracked_metabolites` variables near the top of `dfba.py`.

### dFBA output
The dFBA program will display some text output and graphs with the simulation results. Output from tracked reactions and metabolites will be written to `data/fluxes.xlsx`, `data/met_fluxes.xlsx`, and `data/<met>flux_in.txt` and `data/<met>flux_out.txt`. These files support MATLAB plotting functions.

The logistic concentration curves should appear as follows:
